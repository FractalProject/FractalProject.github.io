## What is Fractal?

Fractal is an organization dedicated to providing detailed and easy-to-understand
guides for machine learning and computer science concepts. Say you're a student
who is really interested in machine learning, which you've heard a lot of great
things about, but you're not sure how to get started learning it because there
are so many different components and you're not sure how everything fits together.
You've heard of Tensorflow, you can code in Python, you know some calculus perhaps,
and you've heard of neural networks, but you're just not sure how all these fit
together.

Thats where Fractal comes in. We aim to create guides that clearly show how all
these topics and technologies fit together to make machine learning possible, and
then demonstrate their capabilities. We take you from downloading your first
text editor all the way to creating convolutional neural networks and implementing
reinforcement learning algorithms.

In addition to our guides, we are also interested in researching researching
applications of reinforcement learning (RL), and exploring new methods in RL.

## Our Team


Michael: President, Founder

Michael founded Fractal in 2017 at Stanford University while taking
entrepreneurship classes at Stanford Summer Session. He wanted to encourage STEM 
education by making it easier for people interested in machine learning and 
computer science in general to get started in those fields. Later he began
researching reinforcement learning and integrated his research into Fractal to
showcase this growing subfield of machine learning.


Preston: Researcher

Preston joined Fractal in the summer of 2018.
